### Hey

I'm MindSwipe and I like to code and learn while doing it.

I've been doing C# and .NET programming professionally for just over four years, three of which were during my education.  
In my free time I like to experiment closer to the hardware, namely doing Graphics Programming and using Data Oriented Design principles in Rust for high performance applications.
